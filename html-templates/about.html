                        <h3>JOSH - The Phoenix</h3>
                        <p>
                            In today’s corporate world scenario where major significance is given to referrals, alumni association has become the need of the hour. 
                            The alumni act as a goodwill ambassador representing all that is superlative and ideal about their respective institutions. Apart from providing a platform for cherishing the nostalgic moments of their yester years, 
                            the alumni plays a significant part in providing educational and career guidance to the existing students. St.James has played a vital role in shaping its pupil into responsible and equitable individuals. 
                            This provided the spark for concocting JOSH, uniting students from its nascent 1993 batch to the neoteric batch of 2013. JOSH-THE PHOENIX came into existence on January 2010, eponymous with the phoenix bird of the Greek mythology. Initially THE PHOENIX comprised of 150 members of 2008 and 2009 batch, which due to the untiring efforts of the alumni has outgrown into a colossal group that boasts a current strength of more than a thousand members.
