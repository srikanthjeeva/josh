                        <h3>L’Orientation Professionelle</h3>
                        <p>
                        Helping our juniors to perfectly fit in their passion is exactly what we do 

here. We do two Career Counselling phases, for 10th students and for 12th students. On this 

day, the students will be given guidance about what their next step going to be, by the 

Joshians who are proficient in various fields. So the entire event will be full of career info, 

motivational talks and fun riddles.

                              L’Orientation Professionelle happens twice a year that is one for 10th 

students and another for 12th students. We encourage queries from the students after each 

session so that we get to know what they actually want to know. Information regarding 

competitive exams, course details, college details, board exam tips, entrance exam details 

will be provided to the students on this day.  So thus this event takes our student’s 

perception of education to a complete different level.
                        </p>
                        <h3>JAMFEST</h3>
                        <p>
                            JAMFEST embraces twenty five plus events, titled under different 

categories like arts, literary and cultural.  Each and every event is designed for senior and 

junior category separately. Participants from distinctive schools, around 400 students 

compete to win the overall final trophy.  A judge panel of one internal judge (Joshian who is 

skilled at that particular event), one external judge, and a staff member of James will be 

judging the entire event and the winners will be decided by the total points awarded by the 

judge panel.  Food stalls, fun games and many other lively factors will be going on 

simultaneously. We shaped JAMFEST to create wings to young talents.

                        <h3>JOSH Talent League</h3>
                        <p>JOSH Talent League is a real treat for the students of St James. Students 

from kinder garden to higher secondary, participates in JTL. JTL has twenty plus events 

categorised as arts, literary and cultural. With the best set of contestants, audiences, judges 

and staffs we take this event forward to create opportunity and space to showcase the 

ability of Jameians and to award them for what they are really enthusiastic about.</p>
                        <h3>Alumni Get-togethers</h3>
                        <p>
JOSH-The Phoenix is an alumni crew with nearly 1300 members from 

various parts of the world. We take pleasure in organising events like Career Counselling, JTL 

, Jamfest.  So to make this happen without any shades of flaws, to strengthen 

communication among all joshians, to enhance the bond between each of us, to give 

detailed description on what we are carrying on to each and every alumnus, we put 

ourselves together on a complacent day to sit and have casual discussions to take JOSH to 

the next level of improvement. We validate feedbacks after each event and try to put it in a 

right shape.  It gives us satisfaction that we give back something worth and useful to the 

place which carved us so finely to be in the position we are right now. So we are planning 

out alumni get-together every year to strengthen JOSH.                       
                        </p>
