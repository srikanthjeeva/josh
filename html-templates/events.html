                                        Helping our juniors to perfectly fit in their passion is exactly what we do 

                                        here. We do two Career Counselling phases, for 10th students and for 12th students. On this 

                                        day, the students will be given guidance about what their next step going to be, by the 

                                        Joshians who are proficient in various fields. So the entire event will be full of career info, 

                                        motivational talks and fun riddles.

                                        La’ Orientation Professionelle happens twice a year that is one for 10th 

                                        students and another for 12th students. We encourage queries from the students after each 

                                        session so that we get to know what they actually want to know. Information regarding 

                                        competitive exams, course details, college details, board exam tips, entrance exam details 

                                        will be provided to the students on this day.  So thus this event takes our student’s 

                                        perception of education to a complete different level.

                                        junior category separately. Participants from distinctive schools, around 400 students 

                                        compete to win the overall final trophy.  A judge panel of one internal judge (Joshian who is 

                                        skilled at that particular event), one external judge, and a staff member of James will be 

                                        judging the entire event and the winners will be decided by the total points awarded by the 

                                        judge panel.  Food stalls, fun games and many other lively factors will be going on 

                                        simultaneously. We shaped JAMFEST to create wings to young talents.

                                        JOSH-The Phoenix is an alumni crew with nearly 1300 members from 

                                        various parts of the world. We take pleasure in organising events like Career Counselling, JTL 

                                        , Jamfest.  So to make this happen without any shades of flaws, to strengthen 

                                        communication among all joshians, to enhance the bond between each of us, to give 

                                        detailed description on what we are carrying on to each and every alumnus, we put 

                                        ourselves together on a complacent day to sit and have casual discussions to take JOSH to 

                                        the next level of improvement. We validate feedbacks after each event and try to put it in a 

                                        right shape.  It gives us satisfaction that we give back something worth and useful to the 

                                        place which carved us so finely to be in the position we are right now. So we are planning 

                                        out alumni get-together every year to strengthen JOSH.
