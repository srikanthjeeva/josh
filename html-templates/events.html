                                        La' Orientation Professionnelle happens twice a year, one for the 10th standard students and another for the 12th standard students. We encourage questions from the students after each session so that we get to know what they actually want to know. Information regarding competitive exams, course details, college details, board exam tips, entrance exam details will be provided to the students on this day.  So thus this event takes our student's perception of education to a completely different level.

                                        JOSH-The Phoenix is an alumni crew with nearly 1300 members from various parts of the world. We take pleasure in organising events like Career Counselling, JTL and Jamfest. To carry out all these flawlessly, to strengthen communication among all Joshians, to enhance the bond between each of us, to give detailed description on what is being done, to each and every alumnus, we gather on a day to discuss steps and ideas to take JOSH to the next level of improvement. We validate feedbacks after each event and try to give them right shape.  It gives us satisfaction that we give back something worthy to the place which has carved us so fine, to be in the position we are right now. Alumni get-togethers are planned once a year to strengthen JOSH.
